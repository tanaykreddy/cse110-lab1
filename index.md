## About Me

I am a second year ~~Math-CS~~ computer science student at UCSD. After I changed my major, as suggested above, I chose to pursue a math minor.

My favorite quote of all time is one by Albert Einstein himself:
> Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

## My Coding Experience

I'm pretty proficient with coding in a variety of languages. For example, here is a classic program written in Python:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Make sure to check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/tanaykreddy) to see a variety of programs which I have written.

You can also see a list of the classes I've taken [here](files/languages.txt), for a general idea of concepts I know.

I also know a variety of programming languages, such as:
 - C
 - C++
 - HTML/CSS/JS
 - Java
 - Python

That being said, I am not equally proficient in all of them. My proficiency in each language can be ranked as follows:
1. Java
2. Python
3. HTML/CSS/JS
4. C
5. C++

## Closing Thoughts

While I hope you got a general idea of who I am, I'm not fully finished with this user page. As you can see, I have a few things left on my TODO list:
 - [x] Add information about my major
 - [x] Add an interesting quote I like
 - [ ] Add some of my hobbies outside of coding
 - [x] Add a sample of my coding ability
 - [x] Add a link to my GitHub
 - [x] Add a list of the classes I have taken
 - [ ] Add my resume
 - [x] Add the languages I know
